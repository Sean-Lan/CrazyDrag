# CrazyDrag
This is my first iOS project. Just following the tutorial iOS Learning 1 of https://github.com/eseedo/kidscoding
Drag the slider as close as possible to the expected value.
A bonus of 100 points will obtain if you hit the right value exactly and one of 50 if your difference is 1.
Have fun!
